# Troubleshooting

## Querying the Jobs Table

`Oban.Job` defines an Ecto schema and the jobs table can therefore be queried as usual, e.g.:

```
MyApp.Repo.all(
  from j in Oban.Job,
    where: j.worker == "MyApp.Business",
    where: j.state == "discarded"
)
```

## Heroku

## Elixir and Erlang versions

If your app crashes on launch, be sure to confirm you are running the correct
version of Elixir and Erlang ([view requirements](#Requirements)). If using the
*hashnuke/elixir* buildpack, you can update the `elixir_buildpack.config` file
in your application's root directory to something like:

```
# Elixir version
elixir_version=1.9.0

# Erlang version
erlang_version=22.0.3
```

Available Erlang versions are available [here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir-otp-builds/blob/master/otp-versions).

## Database connections

Make sure that you have enough available database connections when running on
Heroku. Oban uses a database connection in order to listen for pubsub
notifications. This is in addition to your Ecto Repo `pool_size` setting.

Heroku's [Hobby tier Postgres plans](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-plans#hobby-tier)
have a maximum of 20 connections, so if you're using one of those plan
accordingly.
